# RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game generally played by two players. With this project anyone can run this game online from their web broswers. The project is kept minimalistic so the players can have fast burst of gaming with minimal distractions.   

Live Preview of the project is [here](https://iwantroca.github.io/RockPaperScissors/).

### Rules
- In this game player competes against AI and whoever of both wins the 5 rounds first is considered to be winner. 
- After the game is finished, it can be restarted easily with a restart button. So the player can have multiple short sessions of game and try their luck.    

### Notes
- The project required me to learn the DOM manipulation.
